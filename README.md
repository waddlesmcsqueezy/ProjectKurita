# ProjectKurita
Project Kurita is a modification for Company of Heroes 2 that aims to change and remix the game so that players will have a fresh new experience to try when using the mod. This mod does not intend to be taken as a serious competitive mod, but is not going to be and unbalanced mess. We will attempt to make more viable and fun to use unit without breaking balance.

# Known Issues
- ~~KCH's grenade requires Battlephase 1, which cannot be obtained as OKW.~~ FIXED
- Flamethrower tanks have no animation for firing. As such, flames just seem to appear on the ground. The turrets also dont seem to function. This is likely not fixable, due to the fact that the Sherman and Stuart do not have animation states for flamethrowers.

## Version 1.2 - 2/15/17

### Ostheer Changes
- The Panzer V "Panther" has had it's armor nerfed by 20 from 320 to 300, but it's health was buffed by 30 from 800 to 830 and its accuracy buffed by roughly 10% at all ranges. This hopefully will encourage more sniping from players and make it more vulnerable to soviet frontline tanks.
- The StuG III G's health was nerfed by 80 from 560 to 480, to have the same effects as the Panther. The range may be buffed, but as of now, it seems balanced.

### USF Changes
- Added an M4 "Crocodile" Sherman [320/0/100]. This unit has the same flamethrower as the Churchill "Crocodile", however it is slower than the standard Sherman, and is weaker with NO MAIN GUN. This unit is made at the Armor Company.
- Renamed a unit with a name that rhymes with "Deep" and another that rhymes with "Amber Trance".

### British Changes
- Added an M3 "Satan" Stuart tank [265/0/85]. This unit has the same flamethrower as the Churchill "Crocodile", however it is slower than the standard Stuart, and is weaker with NO MAIN GUN. This unit is made at the Platoon Command Post. This unit may be changed at a later date to have a different flamethrower, as I feel that the Churchill flamethrower is a bit too powerful for this unit. It is however, extremely weak.
- Gave the AEC MK. III the White Phosphorus Shell [0/30/0] ability, similar to the cromwell smoke shell. Has a 15 second cooldown.

## Version 1.1 - 2/3/17

### Ostheer Changes
- Added the StuH 42 tank destroyer [300/0/110] for the Wehrmacht Ostheer. It has the standard StuG III model but fires a 105mm howitzer and is more expensive. Hasn't been properly balanced yet. It can be made in the Support Armor Korps along with the PZ.IV/StuG III etc.

### OKW Changes
- Added Knight's Cross Holders [420/0/0] for OKW. Very powerful squad of 3 officers that bear the Knights Cross medal with very good veterancies. Lacks good utility. Detailed veterancies coming soonâ„¢. Can be built in the Schwerer Panzer HQ. Will likely be changed to the Mechanized HQ.
- OKW SwS HQ Buildings have been given the self destruct ability again. They DO NOT get a replacement if you use this ability.

### USF Changes
- M8 Greyhound now has the M20 Utility Car smoke discharge ability. Creates a smoke cloud at the center of the vehicle.

## Version 1.0 - 1/29/17 - THE KING TIGER OVERHAUL

### General Changes
- All dispatch tanks that are limited to one on the field have a cooldown of 240 seconds that only begins once the unit dies.
- Renamed a ton of units for comedic effect.

### Soviet Changes
- ISU-152, IS-2, SU-85, KV-1/2/8, T-70 have all received the "All is Lost" ram ability at 20% HP [Free].
- Penals can upgrade to a PTRS 41 AT Rifle [0/50/0]. 

### OKW Changes
- King Tiger has received a major overhaul. Now has 2 upgrade packages. Siege tactics [0/70/0] and Defense tactics [0/70/0]. Receives Siege mode at Vet 3 if it has Siege package, receives Ambush mode at Vet 3 if it has defense package. Gets a crew HE defense grenade [0/20/0] and a flare launch ability [0/40/0] with siege package, or a defensive crew smoke grenade [0/30/0] and the pintle mounted MG with Defense package. Front armor buffed from 395 to 400. Nerfed HP from 1280 to 1050. Siege mode replaces the previous Spearhead mode. Siege mode locks turret to a frontal 90 degree arc and decreases speed and mobility by 65%, but increases accuracy and grants suppression from the hull mounted MG34. Ambush mode puts the King Tiger into camoflauge and decreases speed and mobility by 65%, however, it can be detected from approximately 16m away, the same as it's own sight range. It can only enter camoflauge if it is standing still. If the King Tiger is camoflauged, it can use the "Blitzkrieg" ability which grants a large speed boost for 10 seconds. Ambush and Siege mode can be toggled on and off at any time to regain the original speed and mobility, but losing the bonuses.
- Sturmpioneers lose 1 man in the squad but are 10% more accurate. Cost is still the same [240/0/0]. Regains that man at Vet 1. Vet 1 is earned very quickly. Gains 1 extra man at Vet 5. Sturmpioneers now get their medkit ability without veterancy.

### USF Changes
- I&R Pathfinders can upgrade to a Looking Post Kit [80/80/80]. The Looking Post can deploy like to the Major's retreat point and it double's the unit's sight range, but leaves it extremely exposed.
