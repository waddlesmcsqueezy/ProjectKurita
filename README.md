A modification for company of heroes

## Changes
Resource costs are indicated by [Manpower/Munitions/Fuel].
### Version 1.1 - 2/3/17
- Added the StuH 42 tank destroyer [300/0/110] for the Wehrmacht Ostheer. It has the standard StuG III model but fires a 105mm howitzer and is more expensive. Hasn't been properly balanced yet. It can be made in the Support Armor Korps along with the PZ.IV/StuG III etc.
- Added Knight's Cross Holders [420/0/0] for OKW. Very powerful squad of 3 officers that bear the Knights Cross medal with very good veterancies. Lacks good utility. Detailed veterancies coming soonâ„¢.
- M8 Greyhound now has the M20 Utility Car smoke discharge ability. Creates a smoke cloud at the center of the vehicle.

### Version 1.0 - 1/29/17
- ISU-152, IS-2, SU-85, KV-1/2/8, T-70 have all received the ability to ram at 20% HP [Free]
- King Tiger has received a major overhaul. Now has 2 upgrade packages. Siege tactics [0/70/0] and Defense tactics [0/70/0]. Receives Siege mode at Vet 3 if it has Siege package, receives Ambush mode at Vet 3 if it has defense package. Gets a crew HE defense grenade [0/20/0] and a flare launch ability [0/40/0] with siege package, or a defensive crew smoke grenade [0/30/0] and the pintle mounted MG with Defense package. Front armor buffed from 395 to 400. Nerfed HP from 1280 to 1050. Siege mode replaces the previous Spearhead mode. Siege mode locks turret to a frontal 90 degree arc and decreases speed and mobility by 65%, but increases accuracy and grants suppression from the hull mounted MG34. Ambush mode puts the King Tiger into camoflauge and decreases speed and mobility by 65%, however, it can be detected from approximately 16m away, the same as it's own sight range. It can only enter camoflauge if it is standing still. If the King Tiger is camoflauged, it can use the "Blitzkrieg" ability which grants a large speed boost for 10 seconds. Ambush and Siege mode can be toggled on and off at any time to regain the original speed and mobility, but losing the bonuses.
- All dispatch tanks that are limited to one on the field have a cooldown of 240 seconds that only begins once the unit dies.
- I&R Pathfinders can upgrade to a Looking Post Kit [80/80/80]. The Looking Post can deploy like to the Major's retreat point and it double's th unit's sight range, but leaves it extremely exposed.
- Renamed all base rifleman infantry units and some engineers for comedic effect.
- Sturmpioneers lose 1 man in the squad. Cost is still the same [240/0/0]. Regains that man at Vet 1. Vet 1 is earned very quickly. Gains 1 extra man at Vet 5.
- Penals can upgrade to a PTRS 41 AT Rifle [0/50/0].
