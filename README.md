# ProjectKurita
Project Kurita is a modification for Company of Heroes 2 that aims to change and remix the game so that players will have a fresh new experience to try when using the mod. This mod does not intend to be taken as a serious competitive mod, but is not going to be and unbalanced mess. We will attempt to make more viable and fun to use unit without breaking balance.

# Changelog
Resource costs are indicated by [Manpower/Munitions/Fuel].
## Version 1.1 - 2/3/17

### Ostheer Changes
- Added the StuH 42 tank destroyer [300/0/110] for the Wehrmacht Ostheer. It has the standard StuG III model but fires a 105mm howitzer and is more expensive. Hasn't been properly balanced yet. It can be made in the Support Armor Korps along with the PZ.IV/StuG III etc.

### OKW Changes
- Added Knight's Cross Holders [420/0/0] for OKW. Very powerful squad of 3 officers that bear the Knights Cross medal with very good veterancies. Lacks good utility. Detailed veterancies coming soonâ„¢. Can be built in the Schwerer Panzer HQ. Will likely be changes to the Mechanized HQ.

### USF Changes
- M8 Greyhound now has the M20 Utility Car smoke discharge ability. Creates a smoke cloud at the center of the vehicle.

## Version 1.0 - 1/29/17

### General Changes
- All dispatch tanks that are limited to one on the field have a cooldown of 240 seconds that only begins once the unit dies.

### Soviet Changes
- ISU-152, IS-2, SU-85, KV-1/2/8, T-70 have all received the "All is Lost" ram ability at 20% HP [Free].
- Penals can upgrade to a PTRS 41 AT Rifle [0/50/0]. 

### OKW Changes
- King Tiger has received a major overhaul. Now has 2 upgrade packages. Siege tactics [0/70/0] and Defense tactics [0/70/0]. Receives Siege mode at Vet 3 if it has Siege package, receives Ambush mode at Vet 3 if it has defense package. Gets a crew HE defense grenade [0/20/0] and a flare launch ability [0/40/0] with siege package, or a defensive crew smoke grenade [0/30/0] and the pintle mounted MG with Defense package. Front armor buffed from 395 to 400. Nerfed HP from 1280 to 1050. Siege mode replaces the previous Spearhead mode. Siege mode locks turret to a frontal 90 degree arc and decreases speed and mobility by 65%, but increases accuracy and grants suppression from the hull mounted MG34. Ambush mode puts the King Tiger into camoflauge and decreases speed and mobility by 65%, however, it can be detected from approximately 16m away, the same as it's own sight range. It can only enter camoflauge if it is standing still. If the King Tiger is camoflauged, it can use the "Blitzkrieg" ability which grants a large speed boost for 10 seconds. Ambush and Siege mode can be toggled on and off at any time to regain the original speed and mobility, but losing the bonuses.
- Sturmpioneers lose 1 man in the squad but are 10% more accurate. Cost is still the same [240/0/0]. Regains that man at Vet 1. Vet 1 is earned very quickly. Gains 1 extra man at Vet 5. Sturmpioneers now get their medkit ability without veterancy.

### USF Changes
- I&R Pathfinders can upgrade to a Looking Post Kit [80/80/80]. The Looking Post can deploy like to the Major's retreat point and it double's the unit's sight range, but leaves it extremely exposed.
- Renamed all base rifleman infantry units and some engineers for comedic effect.
